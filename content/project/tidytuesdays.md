TidyTuesday is a social data vizualisation project where the community works on vizualisations using public available datasets and R Graphic engine ggplot2. I started 2019 to participate and whenever i find some time i join the action. Below you can find my latest submissions as well as a link to the Code on Github.

#### Trees in San Francisco
This TidyTuesday dataset was about trees in San Francisco. While attending the conference in San Francisco in Jan' 20 i took some pictures and used them as the background for Viz.
